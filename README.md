# SAOS-operating-system

The S.A.O.S opterating system is a project i've been working on for a while.

If you want to build and run this you can run the make file and use the "*qemu-system-i386 -fda boot.iso*" command to emulate the OS.
The current version number is 1.3.6 at the time of this post.

If you have ideas or questions for me you can email me at:
